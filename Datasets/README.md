# Datasets being used

Here we have a combination of three dtaasets that are being used. 

- __Kepler_cummulative__: Contains the Kaggle dataset, primary focus
- __Kepler_total__: Contains the NASA datasets of planets discovered only through the Kepler telescope
- __Planets_total__: ALl possible planets and evaluation metrics through all possible telescopes and methods known. 

Along with this, the __PS_columns.txt__ file gives a brief description of each column type.
