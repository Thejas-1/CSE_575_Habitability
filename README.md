# Habitability Prediction of Exoplanets using Statistical Machine Learning Techniques

The following zip folder consists of the codes required to run and execute the models required for the classification of habitable exoplanets

## Dataset Used

The dataset used is attached as 'PHL_dataset.csv" within this folder. It can be uploaded prior to execution of any of the IPYNB files if they are run on colab, or they can simply stay in this folder. Minor adjustments can be made from:
`df = pd.read_csv('PHL_dataset.csv`)
to:
`df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/My Drive/Datasets/PHL_dataset.csv")`
The latter is used since the dataset is stored on google drive for our project. 

## IPYNB Notebooks

There are three notebooks present in the folder. Each one requires that we simply upload the dataset as mentioned above, and hit run-all. All of them have been proof-checked and run smoothly on our system to ensure that it runs on any system!
